## Hamilton the sheep

- I like how you described how the product/idea came about. Great way to start the pitch.
- Great way you describe social and mobile aspects of the product by making it clear in the pitch
    - Product is clearly social as it involves collaboration between users
    - Design is location specific so it's also mobile.
        - Good example of the great court
- Great interactive presentation and letting the tutors play the game
- fun and interactive
- great incentive by cooperating with the UQNAV app

## Journey

- Great discussion of how you used user feedback to enforce design decisions
- Mobile aspect of it is that there is flexibiity of use, can use before you go to bed etc...
